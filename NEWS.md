# frscore 0.1.01

- patch release with no changes that affect usage; fixes an example in `frscored_cna()` documentation that started throwing an error due to changes in the `cna` package, and stops `frscore()` from throwing a confusing warning when the number of solution types exceeds the value of the argument maxsols.
